School-Management-System
========================

The project work automates school management system. In the system application is
developed, Web based (thin client). The web application facilitates attendance recording, to
view the status of student by their parents and to view reports by teachers.
Our solution of the timetable is very simple. In the high school considered for the project there
are ten subjects for both grade nine and grade ten. Loads are assigned to each subject teacher
and a code is given for each teacher-subject combination. A simple search technique has been
used during allocation of each teacher-subject code to a time slot. A database has been used to
enforce constraints and to store data.
System also facilitate grade reports which is managed by the teacher and can be view by student
and parents later on. It allows parent, student and teacher to communicate internally.
Management can display important notification on home page.
